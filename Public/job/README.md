# ✅ **WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW (Summary)**

**Good base:**

* Linux basics (needs revision)
* GitHub, Docker, Jenkins
* Terraform
* Networking fundamentals (IP classes, LAN, ports, subnets)
* Nmap (needs revision)
* Basic Wireshark usage
* Basic cloud (AWS/GCP)

This is a **great starting point** for L1/L2 Cloud Ops, DevOps, NOC, Infra jobs.

# 🧠 **UPDATED TOPICS YOU *MUST* LEARN (For Redis L1 Ops, NTT NOC, Endava Network Architect Jr)**

Below is a combined list covering **Cloud + DevOps + Networking + Linux + Observability + SRE basics**.

---

# 🔥 **1. Linux (High Priority)**

You need L1/L2 troubleshooting level:

### MUST KNOW:

* Basic commands (ls, cd, cp, mv, chmod, chown, ps, top, htop)
* System logs: `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog`
* Network tools:

  * `ping`, `traceroute`, `ss`, `netstat`, `curl`, `dig`, `nslookup`
  * `tcpdump` basics
* File permissions (rwx)
* Processes & services: `systemctl`, `journalctl`
* Disk/CPU/RAM usage: `df -h`, `du -sh`, `free -m`
* SSH, SCP
* Cron jobs
* Linux networking stack

---

# 🔥 **2. Networking (Critical for all roles)**

For Redis & NTT jobs, you MUST be strong in this.

### MUST KNOW:

* OSI & TCP/IP (very important)
* Subnetting (CIDR, VPC ranges, mask calculations)
* DHCP, DNS, ARP, ICMP, NAT
* Routing basics: static route, default route
* Firewall basics: inbound/outbound rules
* Load balancer fundamentals
* Packet flow (client → server)
* DNS resolution (step-by-step)
* MTU issues, packet drop reasons
* VPN basics (static, IPsec)

---

# 🔥 **3. Packet & Network Tools**

They will ask practical questions:

### MUST KNOW:

* **Nmap** (scan types, port discovery, version scan, OS detection)
* **Wireshark** (filtering: http, tcp, icmp, dns, arp)
* **tcpdump** (basic capture commands)
* **Netcat** (nc - for connectivity testing)

---

# 🔥 **4. Cloud (AWS is mandatory)**

For Redis & Endava:

### MUST KNOW:

* EC2 (SG, Key pairs, AMI)
* VPC (subnets, IGW, NAT, route table)
* S3 basics
* RDS basics
* IAM (roles, policies, users)
* CloudWatch metrics & logs
* ALB/NLB basics
* Troubleshooting:

  * Instance not reachable
  * SG misconfiguration
  * Route table issues
  * DNS not resolving
  * S3 permission denied

---

# 🔥 **5. Terraform (Medium Priority, but must revise)**

Important for Endava Network Architect (Infra).

### MUST KNOW:

* Providers, resources
* Variables/Outputs
* State file
* Terraform workflow: init → plan → apply
* Import & remote backend
* Basic modules

---

# 🔥 **6. Docker + Jenkins (Medium Priority)**

### Docker:

* Images, containers, volumes
* Dockerfile basics
* Networking modes
* Troubleshooting container: logs, exec

### Jenkins:

* Pipeline basics
* CI/CD concept
* Integration with GitHub

---

# 🔥 **7. Observability & Troubleshooting (SUPER HIGH Priority)**

Most L1 jobs ask:

### MUST KNOW:

* Check logs
* Check CPU/RAM
* Check connectivity
* Check firewall
* Read stack traces
* Identify why a service is down
* Check packet drops
* Use CloudWatch/Grafana dashboards

---

# 🔥 **8. Redis Basics (only for Redis role)**

Not deep. Just understand:

* What is Redis?
* What is a cluster?
* Keys, TTL
* Basic commands: `PING`, `SET`, `GET`, `INFO`

---

# 🔥 **9. Soft-skills (very important)**

For all interviews:

* Explain calmly
* Speak logically
* Structure your answers
* Avoid too much technical words in one sentence

---
